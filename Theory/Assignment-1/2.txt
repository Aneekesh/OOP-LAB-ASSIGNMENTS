What is recursion? Discuss different types of recursions using example.

What is Recursion? 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly
is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

Types of Recursions: 
Recursion are mainly of two types depending on whether a function calls itself from within
itself or more than one function call one another mutually. 
The first one is called direct recursion and another one is called indirect recursion
