// Q.2. Write a class CSE21 that has the following data members:
// Int roll;
// Char *name;
// Char grade;
// Create a dynamic constructor to initialize the data members. Create objects ‘student1’ and ‘student2’
// and initialize student2 by student1. Make sure your program never creates a dangling pointer. Code to
// Destroy the objects after their use is over.
